# Coding Challenge

Develop a modal component in ReactJS that meets all necessary accessibility specifications. The goal is to ensure that the modal is fully accessible to users with disabilities, including those using screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies.

## Requirements

### Modal Structure and Appearance

- [x] The modal should be implemented as a React component and can have multiple instances of the modals displayed on the same page.
- [x] It should contain a header, body, and footer.
- [x] The header should include a title.
- [x] The body can be anything and the overflow scenarios need to be handled.
- [x] The footer should contain two buttons: "Close" and "Save".
- [x] The modal should overlay the rest of the page content when active.
- [x] The modal should be responsive.

### Behaviour

- [x] The modal should be initially hidden and only appear when triggered by a button click.
- [x] Clicking outside the modal should close it.
- [x] The "Close" button should close the modal.

### Styling

- The header, body, and footer styles can be extended.
- We leave it to your discretion on which tooling to use.

### Testing

- [x] The codebase should have adequate test coverage.

## What we expect from you

- The solution should be based on ReactJS.
- We should be able to run the solution and visualize the result.
- Necessary documentation to run the solution.
- The code should be shared as a public GitHub repository and the link should be sent to XXXX once the task is completed. Please indicate the total time spent on the task.
- Make commits responsibly and with proper commit messages.
- Leave adequate comments in the code base when needed to provide more clarity.

## What we (mainly) look at when checking out the solution

- Did you follow the instructions, i.e. does your solution work and meet GLS/NXT code challenge requirements?
- Is your solution easy to read and understand?
- Is your solution extensible?

## Final notes

- This challenge is about showing us how you think as an engineer and how you solve problems, not how well you know tool X or Y.
- A follow-up call will be scheduled to discuss the solution in detail after evaluation.
- The deadline to submit the solution is 3 days from the date you received the task.
- If you need any further clarifications regarding the take-home assignment, please feel free to contact us at XXXX and we will be happy to assist you.
